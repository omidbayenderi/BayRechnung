# Product Context: BayRechnung

## Why this project exists
Construction firms often struggle with scattered data across various sites and roles. Site managers use paper or local notes, finance teams wait for reports, and business owners lack a real-time "big picture." BayRechnung solves this by centralizing all management activities into a single, cohesive web platform.

## Problems it solves
- **Data Fragmentation**: Site progress and financial data are often disconnected.
- **Sync Failure**: Offline-first needs are critical for construction sites with poor connectivity.
- **Role Confusion**: Different team members need different views (e.g., Worker vs. Accountant).
- **Invoicing Delays**: Simplified invoice generation with GiroCode and QR payments speeds up the cash flow.

## User Experience Goals
- **Instant Response**: Local-first data loading (LocalStorage) ensures the UI never feels sluggish, even on slow networks.
- **Visual Clarity**: Premium, modern design (dark mode, glassmorphism) that feels state-of-the-art.
- **Cross-Browser Reliability**: Consistent experience across Safari, Chrome, and Mobile browsers.
- **Simplicity vs. Power**: An Admin panel that remains "sade ve güçlü" (simple yet powerful).
